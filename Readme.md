## Introduction
Name of the game was inspired by [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program). In a Slavic mythology, Khors, similarly to Artemis, was believed to be a lunar god. The game is a simple rocket flight simulator with basic physics. It is meant to be a technical preview of ECS implementation in Java and integration with LibGDX library.
## Technologies
